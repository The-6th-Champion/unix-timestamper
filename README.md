# unix-timestamper
This is a small program thing that will get you a unix timestamp.


## How It Works:

Basically, it is very simple. you just run this code somewhere and it returns your timestamp. You can make it go forwards or backwards in hours too.

The `offset` variable is where you can choose the time to go forward or backward a certain amount of hours.
For example:
  `offset = 8`
the unix timestamp will be one that is 8 hours in the future.

###### Note: Im pretty sure This works for all time zones, so there are no conversions needed.

###### Another Note: have fun

###### Not-a-note: sike
